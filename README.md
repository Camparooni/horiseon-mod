![horiseon-mod](horiseon-mod.PNG)

## Description

This project involved the refactoring of the starter code for the Horiseon Webpage. The purpose was to both make the code more comprehensible for smoother future use, and more accessible and optomized for search engines. No display changes were made that would impact the webpage itself. 

### Tasks Completed

* Added unique name to webpage to make it more identifiable in the browser
* Replaced HTML div elements with semantic HTML elements
* Consolidated CSS to remove any unnessary repeats
* Added ALT text to img elements for accessibility
